# Sudoku
Sudoko solver program


This program hopefully solves all sudoku-puzzles.
You can insert numbers from a puzzle in the field and then press the Solve menu.
If you must delete a number press the blank-button on the keyboard.
The calculation was made by multiple calculations in rows, columns and carrees.
If this does not help for the hole field, then the calculation 

was done by brute force mechanismen of precalculated result values.
You can also save a puzzle to an XML-File and open a saved file.
